One of my close friends was a regular Linux user, so it was very easy for me to enter the world of FOSS and Linux. The first time I sat on a Linux distro, what attracted me the most was the adventurous ride of trying out different things and the ability to customize whatever I want without ever worrying about whether a virus might hit my computer. If it crashes? Well boot it up again and everything is back to normal(Or maybe a reinstall 🤭). The awesome part about all of this was the community that made everything. And by everything I mean, there is a community of people who help each other to troubleshoot. That too, free of cost(Some times free as in free beer 🍺).</p>\n<h2>$ init</h2>\n<p>So after a lot of discussions, a few students in our peer group planned to establish a FOSS community in our college. There were a lot of difficulties to start a new cell in our college. First of all, there should be a teaching staff to coordinate the cell and the collective effort of students from all departments are required. Thankfully we’ve got Asst. Prof Syam Sankar(🥰) as our staff coordinator and several students from other departments also to join our community 💪. And this collective made FOSS cell to initialise.</p>\n<h2>First Flight 🐥</h2>\n<p>The next step was to conduct an inaugural ceremony for our newly formed cell. As per Syam Sir's directions, we planned the inauguration. I too got a chance to participate actively in the event planning(Lucky me!).\nWe didn't have to think too much about who will Inaugurate the cell.\nOther than our Praveenettan(പ്രവീണേട്ടൻ - a.k.a Pirate Praveen 🏳️) who else is better to give us the baton.\nEven though I was a member of the FOSS cell I had only a little knowledge about the necessity of using FOSS. This ceremony also had a  session named ‘Privacy Yatra’  for which I was waiting eagerly. The inaugural ceremony was planned to start in the afternoon at 3 PM. There were a lot of works to do to conduct the function.</p>\n<p>Our staff coordinator Mr Syam Sankar and student coordinator Abhinav Krishna did all the necessary permissions and venue arrangements. Our awesome team had all the skills to organize this event beautifully. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 650px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/6c315/decoration.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Decoration\"\n        title=\"Decoration works done\"\n        src=\"/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/a111b/decoration.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/aca85/decoration.jpg 163w,\n/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/0954f/decoration.jpg 325w,\n/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/a111b/decoration.jpg 650w,\n/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/ce471/decoration.jpg 975w,\n/static/9bbbf1d7fd9e794f67e2632aaf0b2c06/6c315/decoration.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>Decoration works done ✌️.</em></p>\n<p>Bhadra and her friends painstakingly did all the wonderful decorations.

The Principal, Sudha Ma'am mentioned about the Contributions of Richard Mathew Stallman, The Founder of Free Software Foundation in the Free and open-source software community and explained why FOSS is important for us, the students.

In that election, there were a lot of challenges for Trump to win the election. But Facebook created a positive impact for trump in their social network and surprisingly Trump wins the election. I just thought how can it be happening?

There are a lot of examples in the world where social media decides what we think. He said that the only possible solution for this controversy is to make emphasis on FOSS and develop FOSS culture on social networking sites. He also mentioned about the FOSS alternatives for the popular social media sites. The main advantage of FOSS social media services is that we can understand to what extent our data is secured.
