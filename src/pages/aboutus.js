        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        NSS NSSCE, the student volunteer body under the jurisdiction of Ministry
        of youth affairs and sports is the largest student volunteer body in the
        campus of NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad. We are a joint student
        volunteer body of two NSS units, 128&198 and is a part of Technical cell
        of National Service Scheme. NSS NSSCE was established in the college
        campus half a centum ago on 1969 with the aim of encouraging student
        participation in public welfare activities using their knowledge and
        skill. Throughout these five decades, NSS NSSCE has grown to be one of
        the best student volunteer body in the state. We are a group of 200
        volunteers who wish to bring a change or a hope however small it maybe.
        Motivated by the principle of NOT ME BUT YOU, we try to organise as many
        activities and give support to various public programs that can bring
        about a small change in person life or can bring a small benefit for the
        society. Many of our activities have been publicly recognised and
        appreciated important ones being Punarjani, Pratheeksha, Santhwanam and
        Unarv. Punarjani is a regeneration programme aimed to regenerate public
        assets. As a part of this programme, we were able to regenerate public
        assets worth crores. Pratheeksha is our blood donation unit. As a part
        of Pratheeksha, we organise blood donation camps every year and we also
        arrange blood for emergency cases in all places of our reach. Santhvanam
        is our fund-raising program aimed at providing financial assistance to
        the needy. Unarv is an educational empowerment programme aiming for the
        empowerment of students from rural areas and to help them break their
        shell of inferior feelings as well as to give them the exposure to the
        outside world and world of opportunities. Apart from these main
        programmes we also do many other activities including LED bulb making,
        paper pen making, campus cleaning, anti-drug programmes, and LED-Green.
        We provide assistance to the district administrations by conducting
        various surveys and data collection. NSS NSSCE is always at the front in
        various public, social and environmental welfare programmes living upto
        the expectation of one of the best student volunteer body. We are a
        group of youths who wish to make the best part of our life worthy, to be
        a light for those who are in the dark, to be a rope for those who are in
        the pit, to be a shoulder for the week to rely on and to be the helping
        hand at the right time. This is what we wish for, this is what we aim to
        do.
